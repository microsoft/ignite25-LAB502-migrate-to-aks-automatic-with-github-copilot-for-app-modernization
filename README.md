### Session Description

Learn how to modernize and migrate a legacy Spring Boot application to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) Automatic using AI-powered tools. This hands-on lab demonstrates the complete journey from local development to cloud deployment, leveraging GitHub Copilot for app modernization to assess code, implement secure authentication patterns, and automate containerization. You'll gain practical experience migrating from traditional password-based authentication to modern Entra ID with workload identity, while deploying to AKS Automatic with built-in security and operational best practices.

### Learning Outcomes

By the end of this session, learners will be able to:

- Use GitHub Copilot app modernization to assess Spring Boot applications for cloud readiness and identify migration opportunities
- Migrate from self-hosted PostgreSQL to Azure Database for PostgreSQL Flexible Server with Entra ID authentication
- Implement passwordless authentication using Azure Workload Identity and Service Connector
- Generate production-ready Docker and Kubernetes manifests using AI-powered containerization tools
- Deploy containerized applications to AKS Automatic with enterprise-grade security and monitoring
